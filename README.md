In this repository I am pushing the current learning progress on the Kotlin Basics of the learning portal [hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/projects/196?track=18). 

The course is built on Grable and contains two packages with my solutions:
1. [Tasks solutions on basic topics](https://github.com/ILYA-NASA/Zookeeper/tree/master/Topics)
2. [Project of this track ](https://github.com/ILYA-NASA/Zookeeper/tree/master/Zookeeper). Below I will show you a screenshot with a description of this project.
